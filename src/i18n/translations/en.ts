      'My journey in tech started in IT infrastructure — support, networking and environment setup — and evolved into software development. Along the way I built responsive websites and interfaces optimized for every device, always focused on delivering real value: faster, more accessible and more enjoyable products.',

      "Today I'm a Software Developer at Hortti, the digital infrastructure for Brazil's food supply centers (Ceasas): a platform that connects every Ceasa in the country in a single place, digitizing the fresh-produce trade and bringing growers, merchants and buyers closer together. There I build features end to end with React, TypeScript, NestJS and PostgreSQL — from database modeling to the UI — applying unit testing and architecture best practices to a product that moves the country's food supply.",
